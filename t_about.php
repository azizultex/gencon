								<p>As every project is initiated, our safety officer and project team members identify the project’s potential hazards and create a specific safety plan for the team. Regular safety inspections are made throughout the project, and reviewed regularly to allow for adjustments.</p>

								<p>Safety is included as a weekly topic in our on-site weekly construction meetings to make sure we are not only ahead of the game where safety on site is concerned, but actively listening to the concerns of our clients and end users as the project progresses.</p>

							<h6>Current project: <span>Bournedale Natural Classroom</span></h6>

							<p>GenCon has partnered with Bournedale Natural Classroom in order to support its mission to enhance and enrich student learning through nature. Through this partnership, the company has donated the funding, staffing, and expertise that has supported the architectural design and layout, project management, and marketing materials.

Site work is underway and we expect to complete the project within the next few months.</p>
